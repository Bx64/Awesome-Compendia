# Compendia Community Fund (CCF) 
# Proposal - Summary

This is a proposal to the community and the validators that support Compendia.

- The Compendia Community Fund (CCF) is a fund that is run by the Compendia community members. It can be seen as supplemental to the core development of the Compendia ecosystem and shall support the ideas and projects of community members to help promote the advancement of the wider ecosystem. 

- It aims (1) to provide a possibility to those Compendia community members that would like to support the ecosystem with contributions of BIND coins for community purposes and (2) to provide a place for community developers to request funding, for projects to develop tools, software or hardware which helps to improve, support and add value to the ecosystem.

- The CCF will be run by Compendia community members - being a validator is not required.

- The CCF will not run an active validator.  Due to the way the Compendia Community Fund is set up, taking up a valuable validator slot is not required.  

- The CCF can be funded by:
    - One-time donations (philanthropy);
    - Regular % shared by community validators;
    - Funding raising events, community sweepstakes and other possible tournaments.
    
- Proposals for funding will be shortlisted using the following method. People submit their proposals using a “Standard Approach” or “Fast Track Approach” template found at the end of this document.

- Several tasks are needed to be completed for the CCF to properly launch. It is the duty of the first board to realise these tasks. The election for this first term will run through the main Compendia Telegram channel.

- Both co-founders [cryptomaniac](https://bindscan.io/wallets/cryptomaniac) & [bfx](https://bindscan.io/wallets/bfx) will not be up for election to the board during the first period of 6 months. Instead, [bfx](https://bindscan.io/wallets/bfx) will act as impartial advisor to the board members when recommendations or advice is needed for the CCF's direction or decisions.

# Compendia Community Fund (CCF) 
# Proposal - Extended

### What is the Compendia Community Fund?

 - The Compendia Community Fund (CCF) is a fund that is run by the Compendia community members. It can be seen as supplemental to the core development of the Compendia ecosystem and shall support the ideas and projects of community members to help promote the advancement of the wider Ecosystem.

### What is the purpose of the Compendia Community Fund?

The CCF has two main purposes: 

- First, is to provide a possibility to those Compendia community members that would like to support the Ecosystem with contributions of BIND coins for community purposes. Funds will be held in a multi-signature address using the ARK desktop wallet feature.

- Second, to provide a place for community developers to request funding, for projects to develop tools, software or hardware which helps to improve, support and add value to the ecosystem.

### Who will run and support the Compendia Community Fund?

- The CCF will be run by Compendia community members - being a validator is not required.

- Each member will be voted into the position through a community election.

- For the day to day operations and the final decisions of the CCF, 3-5 community members will be elected by the Compendia Community. These members will represent the management of the CCF and should act for an initial period of 12 months (to ensure the process is well established), after which a new election should take place. 

- If a board member leaves or decides to step down within the term then we have two options:
    - Invite the runner up from the previous election, if accepted they become a board member, if they do not accept, then;
    - an election will take place quickly to replace the leaving member. 

- Board members will receive no benefit/funding/income or other such benefits directly from the CCF during their term.

- A portal (e.g. website or forum) will be used to display project submission/review, board elections and project status updates.

- In case a project requires some specific knowledge (e.g. technical or coding) the CCF can ask additional members of the community or the Compendia team, which have that specific knowledge, to assist the CCF in its decisions on the projects.

- Any proposed changes to this paper, project templates or the overall running structure of the CCF will be discussed with the wider community (voted if required), on agreement any changes will be implemented promptly.

### Board member elections/voting:

- Each board member will be allocated a unique public address which will be published when the voting begins.

- To vote for a board member a user would just send 0.01 BIND to the unique public address associated with the board member they wish to vote for.

- A web page will be created to show the board member votes and a ranking, a timer will be set for a defined election period, when the time expires, the page freezes and the results are frozen.  The top 5 votes for board nominees will become the 5 CCF Board Members if votes are tied a member will be selected using a random selection tool.

### How will the Compendia Team be involved in the Fund?

- As the CCF is completely separate from the Compendia team, they will not be a part of the management or final decision making of the CCF. Nor will they have access to, or own a share of the collected BIND held by the CCF.

- However, they can provide valuable input on projects and the overall direction of Compendia development. So the idea is to create an Advisory Board with 2 members of the Compendia team. These members can provide recommendations and/or input on projects and proposals. It would be positive to have one member with a development/coding background for any technical questions on the projects.  Also to ensure no duplication of effort by the community developers and Compendia team.

### How will the founding members be involved in the Fund?

- Both co-founders [cryptomaniac](https://bindscan.io/wallets/cryptomaniac) & [bfx](https://bindscan.io/wallets/bfx) will not be up for election to the board during the first period of 6 months. Instead, [bfx](https://bindscan.io/wallets/bfx) will act as impartial advisor to the board members when recommendations or advice is needed for the CCF's direction or decisions. 

### Will the CCF run an active Validator?

- No, the CCF will not run an active Validator.  Due to the way the Compendia Community Fund is setup, taking up a valuable Validator slot is not required.  

- The CCF will, however, set up a Validator name, posting its public BIND address to ensure full transactional transparency to the community. It will not actively forge.

### CCF Funding

- The CCF will not secure funding through running an active validator but may use unallocated BIND to vote for a community validator, helping to maintain/increase funding available to CCF projects.

- The CCF can be funded by:
    - One-time donations (philanthropy);
    - Regular % shared by community validators;
    - Funding raising events, community sweepstakes and other possible tournaments.

### How will the collected funds of the CCF be secured?

- The funds will be stored in a multi-signature wallet or by an escrow, depending on the technical possibilities. It needs to be guaranteed that the funds cannot be misused by any person or group of persons. Looking at one or possibly two multisig escrow accounts.

- Any/all direct donations/or delegates community fund shares should be paid directly to Escrow.

- The Escrow accounts will be managed by the board, using a multi-sig wallet. 

- Project valuations should be given in integer format (rounds numbers / 0 decimals). 

- For projects valued up to, but not including, $5,000:
    - A minimum of three of the five board members would need to approve for a tx/funding to be made.
- For projects valued from $5,000 and over:
    - A minimum of four of the five board members would need to approve for a tx/funding to be made.

### How will the proposals be shortlisted?

- The proposals will be shortlisted using the following method. People submit their proposals using a “Standard Approach or Fast Track Approach” template.

- The template will cover the basics:

    - Who requires the funding?
    - What type of project is it?
    - Description of the project.
    - Timeline of the project.
    - Required Funding.
    - How the project proposer plans to use funds, for e.g.:
        - 50% cost to develop
        - 25% server cost
        - 15% materials/software licences
        - 10% marketing.

- Once submitted, CCF board members and Compendia advisory board members will review the proposal to ensure it is clearly defined, well-structured, and thoroughly thought through.  The CCF board will either accept or reject the proposal.  If rejected the reasons will be given and the project proposer will be given two more opportunities to resubmit before the proposal is moved to archived status.

- The CCF and the Compendia advisory board members will not submit any project directly.  But can choose a community sponsor to represent their proposal.

- Any project that offers the potential to make a profit will be considered on a case by case basis. To assist with future funding, a proposer may choose to provide a proportion of the profit to the CCF.

- The proposal will then be added to a project portal (yet to be defined), possibly a specific webpage/site set up to support the posting of Proposals.

- Once a project has been accepted the CCF board members and the Project Proposer (PP) will agree on a set of measures of success/milestones before formal approval of the proposal is given.

- When approval is confirmed and funding agreed, the PP will be required to submit a forecasted expenditure/burn rate. Funding will be provided on either an agreed milestone basis or a lump sum on completion/validation of the delivered outcome.

- For the avoidance of doubt, all stages/milestones or completed projects will be checked and validated to ensure it meets or exceeds the original proposal.  If not, then funding will be paid based on an estimation of the perceived effort.

- All projects that receive funding must be open-sourced under the MIT-license, and on completion, if applicable, should be submitted to the CCF GitHub repository.

- A landing page on a live domain must be available when applying for funding.

- It must be clearly specified if a submitted project is looking to be a for-profit solution, or aims to incorporate means to earn money, charge users for functionality or handle payments in any other way, be it fiat or cryptocurrency or otherwise, from their project either now or in the future; not specifying this beforehand is grounds for funding to be revoked immediately. Projects that do aim to design a solution that incorporates any of the above should clearly specify how the CCF and Compendia benefit from those functions.

### Information required for project submission

*For medium/large projects a CCF member will be assigned to the project to ensure oversight and technical support where required.*

#### Medium & Large Funding Projects (STANDARD APPROACH)

*Medium Projects - $2500 to $4999 (Bind Value)*
*Large Project - $5000+ (Bind Value)*

The project proposer submits a proposal covering the phases defined below.  A template/ webform will be provided.

- Phase 0 – Requirements Gathering/[Terms of Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_reference) (TOR)
